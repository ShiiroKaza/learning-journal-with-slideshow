                    expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.</p>

                <h1 class="article-title">How I stay committed to learning</h1>
                <p class="article-text">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create 
                    simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
                </p>

                <h1 class="article-title">How I got started</h1>
                <p class="article-text">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. 
                    After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text">That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
